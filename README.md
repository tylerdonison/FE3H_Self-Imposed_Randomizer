# Overview

This program is a phone application that will create a self-imposed set of rules for the game: Fire Emblem: Three Houses.
The idea is that the user will select specific options for a given route of the game, and then restrict themselves according to the randomly generated proficiency types, including two weapons and a class type.
This self-restriction is an interesting way to play the game in a different way that might not have been played otherwise.

As a previous project required me to use Kotlin and learn Kotlin, this program was to implement Kotlin programming in a phone application, as well as learn the basics of andriod mobile programming.

## How to use the Fire Emblem: Three Houses Self-Imposed Randomizer:

1. Select one of the four routes that you are going to play.
2. Select if the downloadable content (DLC) should be included in the randomizer or not.
3. Select the number of other student recruits. Originally these students are in the other two of the three houses in the game, but they can be recruited over. This option choses which students and what they're self-imposed rules will be.
4. Select the number of non-student recruits. This option will randomly pick according to route and dlc and give them a set of self-imposed rules.
5. Click the randomize button.
6. The application will then direct the user to a list of the randomly generated units and proficiencies.
